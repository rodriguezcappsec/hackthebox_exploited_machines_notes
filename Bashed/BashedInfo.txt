Privilege Escalation:

Sudo -l
sudo su scriptmanager /bin/bash -> able to switch user without pass
/home/scripts -> cron job folder ran by root
reverse shell python script that send /bin/bash to specific ip and port
by doing this was able to send a shell with root privileges because root
is the one running the cron job in the background every 1 minute.
